# Raspberry Pi SenseHat Scripts
As of now, all I have here is my Spirit Level script, spirit-level.py

It contains such features as:

 - Detecting Pitch, Roll, and Yaw
 -  Using the pygame library, it displays orientation information in radians and degrees 
 -  Shows yaw by changing the color of the dot
 -  Ability to change the sensitivity of the spirit level, making it more or less difficult to keep the dot centered
 -  Ability to adjust the LED screen refresh rate
 -  Ability to pause the pygame display for smoother motion
 -  Ability to toggle the dot-type between bubble and ball mode
 -  Random color mode just for the heck of it!
